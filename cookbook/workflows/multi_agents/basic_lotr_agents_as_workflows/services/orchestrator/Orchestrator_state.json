The craftsmanship remains stout, enduring through the long dark, yet holders of danger still. No immediate threats stir in the passage, yet shadows linger over hollows deep.\n\nOver head, Aragorn and Legolas, your eyes can sight further\u2014they shall confirm naught unnerves us from above. Beyond lies the Dwarrowdelf\u2014hidden fortunes and unfathomable trespasses.\n\nLet us tread carefully over fine stone-carved floors and pillars robust, for Dwarven architecture, though steadfast, must be respected. If mine eyes deceive not, the passage is clear, but paths unknown warrant cautious steps still.\n\nLead forth with respect to the olden echoes, prove worthy of this venture into Khazad-d\u00fbm.
