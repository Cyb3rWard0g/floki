Using historical knowledge and understanding of the inscription, the team identified \"mellon,\" the Elvish word for \"friend,\" as the key to opening the doors.\n3. Gandalf spoke the word \"mellon\" aloud, successfully unlocking the doors and revealing the entrance to Moria.\n4. Aragorn led the way into the chamber, ensuring the path was clear while Legolas and Gimli provided additional vigilance and support.\n5. Gimli assessed the stonework and confirmed the structural integrity, ensuring there were no immediate threats or traps.\n6. With the area secured, the fellowship entered Moria, prepared for their journey into its depths.\n\nThe path forward is clear and secure, allowing the fellowship to advance into Moria as planned.",

These words offer a clue to those who seek entrance. Across ages, the inscription has remained thus:\n\n*\"Ennyn Durin Aran Moria. Pedo mellon a minno.\"*\n\nTranslated into the Common Speech, it reads: *\"The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria.
