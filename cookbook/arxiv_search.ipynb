The chatter by bots and humans is\\nconsistently different: bots tend to use linguistic cues that can be easily automated (e.g., increased hashtags, and positive\\nterms) while humans use cues that require dialogue understanding (e.g. replying to post threads). Bots use words in categories\\nthat match the identities they choose to present, while humans may send messages that are not obviously related to the\\nidentities they present. Bots and humans differ in their communication structure: sampled bots have a star interaction structure,\\nwhile sampled humans have a hierarchical structure. These conclusions are based on a large-scale analysis of social media\\ntweets across ∼ 200 million users across 7 events.\\nSocial media bots took the world by storm when social-cybersecurity researchers realized that social media users not only\\nconsisted of humans, but also of artificial agents called bots. These bots wreck havoc online by spreading disinformation and\\nmanipulating narratives. However, most research on bots are based on special-purposed definitions, mostly predicated on the\\nevent studied. In this article, we first begin by asking, “What is a bot?\", and we study the underlying principles of how bots are\\ndifferent from humans. We develop a first-principle definition of a social media bot. This definition refines existing academic\\nand industry definitions: “A Social Media Bot is An automated account that carries out a series of mechanics on social media\\nplatforms, for content creation, distribution and collection, and/or for relationship formation and dissolutions.\" With this definition\\nas a premise, we systematically compare the characteristics between bots and humans across global events, and reflect on\\nhow the software-programmed bot is an Artificial Intelligent algorithm, and its potential for evolution as technology advances.\\nBased on our results, we provide recommendations for the use of bots and for the regulation of bots. Finally, we discuss three\\nopen challenges and future directions of the study of bots: Detect, to systematically identify these automated and potentially\\nevolving bots; Differentiate, to evaluate the goodness of the bot in terms of their content postings and relationship interactions;\\nDisrupt, to moderate the impact of malicious bots, while not unsettling human conversations.\\nIntroduction\\nThe notion of “bots” on social media is ubiquitous across many scholarship. These studies captured a range of different social\\nphenomena where bots operate: politics, hate speech, toxicity and so forth. Bots were used to boost the follower count of\\npoliticians in the 2011 Arab Springs uprising, generating false impressions of popularity1, 2. In the same uprising, bots flooded\\nnews streams to interrupt efforts of political dissidents1, 2. In the US 2020 elections, bots augmented human users in strategic\\ncommunications, and actively distorted or fabricated narratives to create a polarized society3–5. More recently, bots aggressively\\npushed anti-vaccine narratives and conspiracy theories on social media during the 2021 coronavirus pandemic6, 7. Bots applied\\nsocial pressure to influence humans to favor the anti-vaccine ideology 3, 8. When the tension of the online ideologies are\\nsufficiently strong, and the spread sufficiently wide, these ideologies spillover to the offline world, resulting in protests, riots\\nand targeted hate-speech9–12. Social media bots gained further media attention in 2022 when Elon Musk proclaimed that at\\nleast 20% of the Twitter users were bots, which were influencing content quality13. Musk later bought the platform, and took\\nsteps to curtail the bot population in a “global bot purge\", which includes removing huge amounts of bots, and charging newly\\ncreated accounts to post and interact on the platform14.\\nMuch research on social media bots involve constructing bot detection algorithms and applying bot detection algorithms to\\nanalyze bot activity during an event. Bot detection algorithms typically extract a series of features from user and post data,\\nthen build a supervised machine learning model which classifies the likelihood of a user being a bot or a human 15. These\\nmachine learning models range from logistic regression16, to random forests17, to ensemble of classifiers4, 18, to deep learning\\nmethods19, 20. Another technique of bot detection is graph-based methods, which infers the probability of a user being a bot by\\nits connections, i.e. friends21, 22. Most recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are incorporated in bot detection algorithms\\nto handle the diverse user information and content modalities23. These bot detection classifiers have been used to study bot\\nbehavior in many events, ranging from political events4, 24–26 to natural disasters27, 27 to the spread of information and opinions\\n1\\narXiv:2501.00855v1  [cs.CY]  1 Jan 2025'),\n",

In fact, the identification of bots by security students are akin to random\\nguesses31. Consequently, it is important to study bots and their characteristic nature and activity patterns. Our study is\\npositioned within the social cybersecurity realm, which studies how the digital environment, particularly bots, can be exploited\\nto alter the content and community relationships32.\\nThis article is being driven by looking at a first principles approach to bots. We ask the following research questions:\\n• RQ1: What is a social media bot? Many studies are predicated on a general purpose understanding of a bot, or a\\nspecific definition particular to the event of study. Instead, we pare down the definition of a bot into its treatment of the\\ncore elements of a social media platform (users, content, relationships).\\n• RQ2: How does the nature of a bot differ from a human? Systematically, we look at the difference between bots\\nand humans. We use a large scale dataset from Twitter/X that spans over 200 million users, and analyzed four aspects:\\nvolume of bot/human user types, use of linguistic cues, use of identity terms, and social interactions.\\nAfter an examination of the social media bot, we discuss how a bot is also an Artificial Intelligent (AI) agent, and its\\npotential evolution alongside technological advancements. We finally follow with a discussion of the open research challenges\\nof the study of bots to encourage future studies in this field. The challenges we identify reflect the definition of a bot: Detect, to\\nsystematically identify these automated and evolving bots; Differentiate, to evaluate the goodness of the bot in terms of their\\ncontent postings and relationship interactions; and Disrupt, to moderate the impact of malicious bots, while not unsettling\\ndigital human communities.\\nWhat is a Social Media Bot?\\nThe term “bot\" has become a pervasive metaphor for inauthentic online users8, 33. Most social media users have an implicit\\nunderstanding of a bot, as do most researchers30. Table 2 summarizes some of the recent definitions of bots retrieved from\\nacademic literature. The security industry also watches social media bot accounts, and Table 3 summarizes definitions from\\nindustry sources. Each of the definition grasps one or more relevant properties (highlighted in bold) of a social media bot, yet\\nare not sufficiently comprehensive to describe the bot. Some of these relevant properties are: “automated\", “interacts with\\nhumans\", “artificial agents\".\\nOne of the problems with existing definitions is that they often define bots as being malicious and they highlight the nefarious\\nuse of bots5, 34–37: “malicious actors\", “public opinion manipulation\", “malicious tasks\"18, 38, 39. Most often, the study of bots\\nis established upon nefarious tasks: election manipulation, information operations, even promoting extremism 33, 34, 40. The\\nexact same technology can be used in both good and bad ways. There are plenty of good bots41–43. Bots provide notifications\\nand entertainment44, such as the @CoronaUpdateBot found in our dataset which posts critical public health information. Bots\\nsupport crisis management efforts by gathering the needs and combined locations of people after a disaster, for authorities and\\ncommunity volunteers to identify crucial areas and providing help45. Chat bots provide emotional support during stress46 and\\ncontinue bonds in times of grieve47. Celebrities and organizations use bots to facilitate strategic communications with their fans\\nand clients3, 48.\\nIn essence, a bot is a computer algorithm. As an algorithm, a bot is neither bad or good. It is the persona it is afforded to\\nthat determines the goodness of its use. We develop a generic definition of a bot. The definition is independent of the use of the\\nbot. The determination of the use of the bot warrants separate treatment beyond this paper. Regardless of whether a bot is used\\nfor good or ill, the behavioral characteristics of bots remain the same.\\nTo better describe the social media bot, we first need to characterize the environment in which it lives: the social media\\nplatform. Within a social media platform, there are three main elements: users, content and relationships49. Users are represented\\nby their virtual accounts, and are the key actors driving the system, creating and distributing information. Content is the\\ninformation generated by users on the platform. Relationships are formed from the user-user, user-content and content-content\\ninteractions.\\nAfter distilling a social media platform into its core building blocks, it follows that definition of a social media bot should\\nbe based on the foundations of a social media platform as first principles. The presence of these components in each of the\\nreference definitions are broken down in Table 4. The first principles of a bot are:\\n• User: An automated account that carries out a series of mechanics. A key characteristic of bots is its programmability,\\nwhich give it its artificial and inauthentic characteristic. Automation is an aspect that has been iterated in all the reference\\ndefinitions. The key here is that a bot is automated. The model underlying the automation does not matter; any model\\ncan be applied equally well to humans and bot. A bot could be built to mimic humans, or it could be built to optimize\\n2/33'),\n",

For example, some studies describe bots in terms of its mimicry of humans33, 50, but others observe that\\nbots eventually influence the social space such that humans mimic bots51, 52.\\n• Content: for content creation, distribution, and collection and processing. Bots often generate their content in bulk to\\ndistribute a certain ideology24, 53, such as a good portrayal of their affiliated country54. Instances where bots perform\\ncontent distribution is where the spread fake news and disinformation content28, 55, 56, or when they distribute general\\nnews information57. Bots in the form of web crawlers and scrapers download and index data from social media in bulk58,\\nand sometimes process the data to perform functions like analyzing sentiment of opinions59.\\n• Relationships: for relationship formation and dissolution. In other words, forming a relationship online means to connect\\nwith other users via post-based (i.e., retweet, mention) or user-based (i.e., following, friend) mechanisms. Dissolving\\na relationship means to destroy a connection by forcing users to leave a community. Bots are an actively form and\\ndestroy relationships on social media platforms. An example of the formation of post-based relationship is the active\\namplification of narratives. This technique is mostly employed in the political realm where the bots retweet political\\nideology in an organized fashion24, 60, 61. User-based relationships can grow through coordinated fake-follower bots,\\nthat are used to boost online popularity62, or can be dissolved through toxic bots that spread hate and directed religious\\nideologies40, 63, causing users to break away from the community64.\\nFigure 1 reflects a first principles definition of a social media bot. A Social Media Bot is “An automated account that carries\\nout a series of mechanics on social media platforms, for content creation, distribution, and collection and processing, and/or for\\nrelationship formation and dissolutions.\" This definition displays the possibilities of mechanics that the bot account can carry\\nout. A bot does not necessarily carry out all the mechanics. The combinations of mechanics that a bot carries out thus affects\\nthe type of bot it is and the role it plays within the social media space, and as shown in Table 1, those mechanics can be used for\\neither good or bad. Bot types can be named for their actions or for their content. For example, a bot that carries out relationship\\nformation between two different communities, and does not do any content mechanics can be classified as a bridging bot16. We\\nillustrate a few types of bots and their use for good and bad in Table 1. Note that this list is not meant to be an exhaustive list\\nbut an illustrative list of the variety of bots in the social media space.\\nFigure 1.Definition of Social Media Bot.

This is in line with past work, where a general sample of\\nusers usually reveal a bot percentage below 30%70, yet in a politically-charged topic (i.e. elections, tensions between countries),\\nthe bot percentage rises34, 80. Our estimate is also empirically consistent with Elon Musk’s estimate of 20%13. This finding is\\nimportant for event analysis, because it provides a comparison baseline towards the percentage of bot-like users within an event.\\nSpikes in bot user percentage beyond 20% suggest that the event and conversation has caught the interest of bot operators, and\\nthe analyst can monitor for signs of conversation manipulation.\\n19.7%\\n80.3%\\n43.9%\\n56.1%\\n18.5%\\n81.5%\\n18.4%\\n81.6%\\n20.4%\\n79.6%\\n17%\\n83%\\n15.7%\\n84.3%\\n21.9%\\n78.1%\\nAsian Elections\\nBlack Panther\\nCanadian Elections 2019\\nCaptain Marvel\\nCoronavirus 2020−2021\\nReOpen America\\nUS Elections 2020\\nOverall\\nDataset\\nPercentage\\nClass\\nBot\\nHuman\\nFigure 2.Comparison of Bot volume across events. The percentage of bot users across the events are on average around 20%.\\nHow do bots differ from humans linguistically?\\nWe extract psycholinguistic cues from the tweets using the NetMapper software 81. The software returns the count of each\\ncue in the sentence, i.e., the number of words belonging to the cue in the tweet. There are three categories of cues: semantic,\\nemotion and metadata. Semantic and emotion cues are derived from the tweet text, while metadata cues are derived from the\\nmetadata of the user. Semantic cues include: first person pronouns, second person pronouns, third person pronouns and reading\\ndifficulty. Emotion cues include: abusive terms, expletives, negative sentiment, positive sentiment. Metadata cues include:\\nthe use of mentions, media, URLs, hashtags, retweets, favorites, replies, quotes, and the number of followers, friends, tweets,\\ntweets per hour, time between tweets and friends:followers ratio.\\nFigure 3a presents the differences between cues used by bots and humans. The detailed numeric differences are in the\\nSupplementary Material. This difference is examined overall, and by event. There are consistent differences in the use of cues\\nby bots and humans. For example, across all events, bots use significantly more abusive terms and expletives, and tweet more\\nthan humans. On the other hand, humans use more first person pronouns, positive sentiment, and media (i.e., images, videos).\\nHumans tend to quote and reply to tweets, while bots tend to retweet.\\nMost events have consistent cue distribution, but some events look different. In general, humans use more sentiment cues.\\nHowever, in the two elections (US Elections 2020 and Canadian Elections 2019), bots used more sentiment cues. This reveals a\\ndeliberate attempt to use bots during the election seasons to polarize online sentiments. Prior research has shown that bots can\\nbe highly negative during the election season82, and that bots express hugely different sentiment sentiment when mentioning\\ndifferent political candidates8, 83.\\n6/33'),\n",

The question though, is\\nwhether the bots that are sending original tweets match the linguistic profile of those retweeting, or is the linguistic profile\\ndifferent? For the Black Panther and Captain Marvel events (Figure 3b), we compared the psycholinguistic profile for all tweets,\\nand the original tweets only (i.e., no retweets). In these two events, bots retweet significantly more than humans. However, the\\nbot-human difference between linguistic cue use of the original tweets vs all tweets are rather similar. Only the average tweet\\nreading difficulty and the number of friends are different: in original tweets, humans have higher values; in all tweets, bots have\\nhigher values. Therefore, bots have their unique signature when generating new content, but are guaranteed to match human’s\\ncontent when retweeting the human’s.\\nBots construct tweets with cues that can be easily and heavily automated, while humans construct more personal tweets that\\nrequire higher cognitive processing to create. Such differences shows how bot accounts still use rather rudimentary techniques:\\nhashtag latching using multiple hashtags 27, 40, connecting several users together with increased number of mentions 54 and\\nflooding the zone with lots of tweets tweets of their desired narratives 24, 84. More sophisticated communication techniques\\nlike having an increased number of media, and more advanced interaction techniques that involve dialogue understanding like\\nincreasing the number of replies and quotes, are still left to the humans. In short, bots have not entirely mimicked humans, yet.\\nHow do bots present themselves differently from humans?\\nSocial identity theory depicts how social media users portray their image online, and the community that they want to be\\nassociated with85, 86. We analyze the difference in the self-presentation of the identities between bots and humans, and the\\ndifference between the linguistic cues used by the identities. Across the events, there are consistently a smaller proportion of\\nbots that present with an identity. Overall, 21.4% of bots present an identity, while 27.0% of humans present an identity (see\\nAppendix Table 10). Bots are more likely to obfuscate their identities87, allowing them to take on different personas to suit their\\noperation requirements88. Figure 4a presents the top 25 identities by frequency between bots and humans. There is a more\\nexponential drop of the frequency of the use of identities in bot users than in human users, suggesting that bots concentrate their\\nself-presentation on certain identities, mostly the common ones: man, son, fan, lover; while humans have a more varied identity\\npresentation.\\nWe then ask a follow-up question: “How do the same bot/human identities talk about the same topics?\" We compare the use\\nof topic frames per identity for the most frequent identity affiliations in Figure 4b. This plots the percentage difference of the\\nuse of framing cues (Family, Gender, Political, Race/Nationality, Religion) between bots and humans. This metric compares\\nthe use of cues with the human usage as a baseline. Overall, bots converse more aggressively in all topic frames. In particular,\\nbots converse most around societal fault lines: gender, political, race/nationality. These conversations lie on societal fault\\nlines, which could sow discord and chaos89, therefore such bots are of interest to monitor and moderate. In fact, bots use more\\ngender-based cues. Other research groups have also identified that a disproportionate number of bots that spread disinformation\\nare females90, 91, and are thus more likely to use gender frames in their posts. Bots tend to converse largely about political\\ntopics, regardless of the identity they affiliate with, indicating that a good proportion of bots are deployed for political purposes,\\neither by political parties or by political pundits 16, 26, 68. Finally, the difference between the usage of topic frames between\\nbots and humans could be due to their vocabulary used. The words used by humans are more varied and mostly not standard\\ndictionary words, while bots are still being programmed with a limited set of vocabulary, as evidenced by the proportion of\\nwords identified by the dictionaries in the NetMapper program used. In a similar aspect, chat bot interactions have a more\\nlimited vocabulary than human interactions92.\\nFigure 4c presents the average use of topic frames by identity categories. Humans affiliate themselves equally with all\\nidentity categories, while bots generally affiliate themselves with racial and political identities. Both bots and humans converse\\na lot on gender and political issues.\\nBots converse mostly about topics that closely match their identity. For example, a bot that presents itself as “man\" and\\n“son\" mostly converse about family then gender; while bots that take on the identities “conservative\" and “american\" converse\\nsignificantly more about politics. This observation can be read from the heatmap: for the bots that associate with the religion\\nidentity, the average use of religious words is 0.04, while that for humans is 0.00. If the users associate with the family identity,\\nthe average proportion of the use of family words within the content is 0.19 for bots and 0.04 for humans. Such is the curated\\npresentation and programming of bot users, which allows for an aspect of predictability - if a bot user affiliates with a certain\\nidentity, it is likely to talk about topics related to its identity. This shows that bots are likely designed to look like humans. They\\nare strategically designed to be in character by having the right affiliation to fit in and converse with a specific group.\\nOur observations in the affiliation of identities by bots in their user description and the use of identity-related topic frames\\nmeans that bots are being used strategically. They are not just used to support or dismiss groups in general, but are specifically\\nbeing aimed at a gender (i.e., women or men), or at a political actor (i.e., president, governor, politician). Bots are overused in\\nthe political, religious, and racial realm, suggesting that they are targeting topics of societal tensions.\\n8/33'),\n",

Therefore, bots appear in star networks in many of the peripheral nodes. A star\\nstructure is a network that have a strongly connected core and peripheral networks. This structure is most prominent in bots in\\npolitical discourse, where core bots create information, and peripheral bots amplify the information through the retweeting\\nmechanic24. Humans, on the other hand, are more likely to be part of a tree structure, where one can make out the tiered\\nfirst- and second-hop interactions. In the same discourse, humans are more likely to be performing many actions, sometimes\\nretweeting other users, sometimes tagging other users and so forth.\\nThis difference in interactions between bot and human users reveals the communication patterns of both user classes. The\\nstar structure of bots suggests that they have a hierarchy of interconnected bot users in an operation network to disseminate\\ninformation, which is easily achieved with the help of automation. On the other hand, humans communicate predominantly\\nwithin their immediate network before extending their communication outwards. The bot ego networks are more dense,\\nsignifying that they were constructed to interact more than do humans, and are sometimes constructed as networks of bots (the\\nbotnet)94, 95.\\nDiscussion\\nThrough our large scale empirical study, we show that bots and humans have interesting and consistent differences between\\nthem. These differences span from their volume, to the linguistic features of their text, to the identities they affiliate with, to\\ntheir social network structure. These features can be used to characterize a social media bot, and how it differs from humans.\\nWe study a huge amount of data dated from 2018 to 2021. These data show consistent differences over the years, which means\\nthat while bot technology do evolve, it does not evolve drastically. Moreover, the consistent differences show that there are\\nscenarios where bots can be better than humans, and scenarios where humans can be better than bots. These differences provide\\ninsights to how both can be utilized to afford conversations on social media: bots can be used for methodological postings with\\ndeliberate selection of hashtags, tweets per hour, and a structured star communication network. Humans can be used for more\\ncomplex cognitive tasks such as adding media to a post or replying to a post, and for conversing on a larger range of topics3.\\nStrengths of Social Media Bots\\nAn Artificial Intelligent (AI) system is a machine, or computer system, that can perceive its environment and use intelligence to\\nperform actions to achieve defined goals96. The social media bot perceives the digital environment to decide their targets (i.e.,\\nusers to retweet, users to mention), and intelligently carry out content and interaction mechanics to achieve their goals (i.e.,\\nspreading information28, 56, sowing discord97, 98, assisting the community45–47). The software-programmed social media bot is\\nan AI algorithm, and thus has potential to be harnessed for social good.\\nTable 6 lists some recommendations of our results on how bots can be leveraged on for social good, and how they can be\\nregulated. First, given that bots use more retweets and mentions than humans, and have high tweets per hour, bots can be used\\nfor menial tasks like announcements and distribution of information. Second, since bots have a star interaction network, they\\ncan be used for big announcements like disaster and crisis management without message distortion. A star network sends\\nmessages directly through interactions, hence the original message is preserved. However, the human’s hierarchal interaction\\nnetwork will distort the message as it passes through the tiers. Third, bots typically post content that matches their identity,\\nthey can be used to provide educational material about topics that people associate with certain profession. For example, a\\nweather news bot can provide weather information. Lastly, since bots use more abusive and expletive terms than humans,\\ninstead of regulating toxic language itself, regulation can be focused on disallowing bots to use such toxic language, which\\nwould therefore reduce the amount of hyperbole and offense online.\\nResult Recommendation\\nBots use a lot of retweets and mentions, and have\\nhigh tweets per hour\\nUse bots for menial tasks like announcements and amplification of\\nannouncements\\nBots have a star interaction network Use bots for big announcements (e.g., disaster, crisis management) with-\\nout message distortion\\nBot content matches identity Use bots to provide educational material about topics that people asso-\\nciate with certain professions (e.g. weather information from a weather\\nnews bot)\\nBots use more abusive and expletive terms than\\nhumans\\nFocus regulation to disallow bots to use toxic language\\nTable 6.Recommendations of our observations on leveraging and regulating bots for social good\\n11/33'),\n",

However, these automated agents are constantly\\nevolving and adapting their behavior in response to the changing setup of social media platforms and user patterns. The\\nstricter data collection rules of social media platforms99, 100 and the increasing usage of AI in these bot agents73 creates further\\nvariability in these digital spaces bots reside in. This therefore muddles any developed algorithms based on previous datasets.\\nAlready, linguistic differences between bot and human tweets have narrowed between 2017 and 2020, making bot accounts\\nmore difficult to systematically differentiate19. More recently, AI-powered botnets have emerged, using ChatGPT models to\\ngenerate human-like content73, closing the gap between bot and human.\\nBot evolution and bot detection are thus a “never-ending clash\"101, and sometimes bot accounts evolve faster than current\\nknown bot detection algorithms68, presenting several opportunities in continual improvement of bot detection algorithms,\\nspecifically to be adaptable, faster, and more efficient. The increasing trends of using Large Language Models and Large Vision\\nModels to create generated texts and deepfakes lend bots a helping hand in the construction of more believable narratives.\\nThese same generative technology are also used to construct offensive bots for humor102. However, current trends reflect that\\nthe use of such technologies are not very prevalent, for example,73 only found one set of such botnet in their study, reflecting\\nthat bots are still relying on traditional techniques, likely because such heuristic-based techniques are easier and faster to deploy\\nen masse.\\nDifferentiate After identifying which users are likely to be bots, one must differentiate the goodness of the bot and its function.\\nThis evaluation can be inferred from the bot’s content postings and relationship interactions. However, bots do not fall squarely\\nin a spectrum of goodness; the lines of good and bad bots are blurred. In fact, bots can move between neutral in which they\\npost messages that are not harmful, to bad, where they post politically charged and extremist messages40, 103. Herein lies an\\nopportunity to construct a rubric to determine the goodness of the bot; this, though, is a complex task, for there are ethical and\\nsocietal issues to consider. Bots can change their goodness, too. They may be supporting a certain cause initially, then making\\na swing to a different stance soon enough. This swing of support was witnessed during the coronavirus pandemic era, and\\nespecially so when the bots require little conviction to change allegiances8. Another challenge involves identifying the type\\nof bot, which can provide insight towards possible impact of the bot. For example, an Amplifier Bot that intensifies political\\nmessages could be intended to sow discord24, 61.\\nDisrupt The third challenge is to mindfully disrupt the operations of bot users. That is, moderating the impact of malicious\\nbots, while not unsettling human conversations. While banning bot users can be an easy solution, a blanket ban can result in\\nmany false positives, which thus results in humans being identified as bots and being banned. Such situations can result in\\nemotional or psychological harm of the human being banned, or toxic online behavior where users repeatedly report another\\nuser that they personally dislike as a bot to silence them104. Additionally, social media bots do not necessarily work alone: they\\ncoordinate with other bots – sometimes even human agents – to push out their agenda80, and therefore if one agent warrants a\\nban, should the entire network be banned? To ban an entire network may entangle several unsuspecting humans who have been\\ninfluenced by the bots to partake in the conversation. With these considerations in mind, regulation is a scope of problem with\\nwhich to be studied: which types of bots should we ban? What are the activities of a bot that would warrant a ban?\\nMethods\\nExamining Bot Literature\\nWe examined recent bot literature for the definition of “social media bot\". For academic definitions, we searched the phrase\\n“social media bot\" on Google Scholar. For industry literature, we searched the phrase “social media bot\" on Google Search.\\nThen, we manually scanned through the results. We picked out the more relevant and highly cited papers that had a definition of\\na social media bot. We read through each paper, and manually extracted the definition of a social media bot stated in the paper.\\nNext, we looked through all the definitions and picked out key phrases. We then harmonized the phrases and definitions to\\ncreate a general definition of the bot. All authors agreed on the definitions and categorizations.\\nData Collection and Labeling\\nWe collected a dataset from Twitter/X involving global events which provides a richness in a general understanding of the bot\\nand human differentiation. The list of data collection parameters are detailed in Appendix Table 8.\\nWe labeled each user in this dataset as bot or human with the BotHunter algorithm. This algorithm uses a tiered random\\nforest classifier with increasing amounts of user data to evaluate the probability of the user being a bot. The algorithm returns\\na bot probability score that is between 0 and 1, where scores above 0.7 we deem as a bot, and scores below 0.7 we deem\\nas a human. This 0.7 threshold value is determined from a previous longitudinal study that sought to identify a stable bot\\n12/33'),\n",

This bot algorithm and threshold is chosen so that our\\nstudies will be consistent with the original studies of the dataset that used the BotHunter algorithm9, 34, 77–80. We calculated the\\nproportion of bot users against the total number of users within each event. Our results are presented in a bar graph.\\nComparison by Psycholinguistic Cues We parse the collected dataset of tweets through the NetMapper software 81 to\\nextract out psycholinguistic cues of the texts. NetMapper extracts the number of each of the cues per tweet. The software\\nreturns three types of cues: semantic cues, emotion cues and metadata cues. The linguistic cues are returned by matching words\\nagainst a dictionary for each category. The dictionary has words in 40 languages. Then, for each user, we average the use of\\neach cue per category, as the trend for the user. We then perform a student t-test comparison between the cues of each user type\\nwith Bonferroni correction, and identify whether the cues are significantly different between the bot and human at the p < 0.05\\nlevel. We then remove the retweets from the Captain Marvel and Black Panther datasets and compare the cue distribution of\\noriginal tweets with all tweets. This analysis compares the differences in the distribution of cues of tweets originating from the\\nuser type and their retweets.\\nComparison by Self-Presentation of IdentityTo classify identities, we compare the user description and bio information\\nagainst a survey of occupations of United States users performed in 2015105. If the occupation is present in the user information,\\nthe user is tagged with the identity. A user can have more than one identity. We compare the top identities used by bots and\\nhuman users across all events. These identities are also divided up into seven categories: religion, race/nationality, political, job,\\ngender, family and others. We then classify each user into these categories of identities. Again, each user can fall into multiple\\ncategories.\\nNext, we examined how different identities frame their posts differently. We extract framing cues from the overall set of of\\npsycholinguistic cues generated. The topic frames we examined are: family, gender, political, race/nationality and religion. For\\neach most frequent identity affiliated with by bots and humans, we compare the difference in the average use of each topic\\nframe through a percentage difference calculation. The percentage difference in the use of framing cues is calculated as: (H−B)\\nH ,\\nwhere H is the average use of the framing cue by humans, and B is the average use of framing cue by bots. This comparison\\ntells us how much more bots use a framing cue as compared to humans. If the percentage is negative, bots use the framing cue\\nmore than humans. If the percentage is positive, bots use the cue less than humans.\\nThe set of topic frames also corresponds with the identity categories. Therefore, we also compared the identity categories\\nagainst the average use of each topic frame. This comparison is performed across bots and humans. We plot heatmaps to show\\nthe relationship between the average use of each topic frame topic frame against the identity categories.\\nComparison by Social Interactions We construct the all-communication ego-networks of the users in our dataset. We\\nanalyzed all the users for Asian Elections, Black Panther, Canadian Elections 2019, Captain Marvel and ReOpen America\\nevents. Due to the size of the data, we analyzed a 2% sample of users of the Coronavirus2020-2021 users (N = 4.6mil), and a\\n50% sample of users from the US Elections 2020 (N = 500k). The ego-networks are network graphs of the bot and human users\\nin focus. In the networks, each user is represented as a node, and a communication interaction between users are represented as\\nlinks. The ego-networks are constructed using all-communication interactions, that is any communication between users (i.e.,\\nretweet, @mentions, reply, quote) is reflected as a link. We analyzed the network properties of the ego-networks constructed\\nper event. These properties are: total-degree, in degree, out degree, density. We also analyzed the number of bot and human\\nalters there are in the ego networks. No pre-processing were performed on the networks prior to the calculations. We used the\\nORA software to load in the networks and perform the calculations81. We finally visualize the network graphs of one- and two-\\ndegree ego networks of a sample of bots and humans Figure 5. These are the 20 most frequent communicators in the Asian\\nElections sub-dataset A 1-degree network shows alters (connected users) that are in direct communication with the user, and a\\n2-degree network shows alters in direct communication with the 1st-degree alters.\\nConclusion\\nSocial media bots are deeply interweaved into our digital ecosystem. More than half of the Internet traffic in 2023 were\\ngenerated by these AI agents106. Bots are able to generate this volume of traffic because of their use of automation, which\\nenables them to create more content and form more relationships. This article surmised a definition of a social media bot\\nbased on the three elements that a social media platform contains: user, content, interactions. Our definition breaks down\\nthe automation on social media platforms into its core mechanics, and therefore provide the foundation for further research,\\nanalysis and policies regulating the digital space. We performed a large scale data analysis of bot and human characteristics\\nacross events around the globe, presenting the uniqueness of the bot species from a macro perspective: how bots and humans\\ndiffer in terms of the use of linguistic cues, social identity affiliations and social interactions. On a global scale, bots and\\nhumans do have consistent differences, which can be used to differentiate the two species of users. Table 7 summarizes the\\ndifferences between bots and humans as a conclusive remark. Finally, we provide recommendations for the use and regulation\\n13/33'),\n",
